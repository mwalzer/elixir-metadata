Investigation Identifier	"PXD004501"
Investigation Title	"Comparative proteomic analysis of human malignant ascitic fluids for the development of gastric cancer biomarkers."
Investigation Description	"Ascites is a valuable source of cancer biomarkers, because it contains a variety of secreted and shed proteins from cancerous cells. Conversely, most proteomic studies on ascites have focused on ovarian cancer and provided insufficient depth for biomarker discovery. Further, no proteomic analysis of ascites from gastric cancer has been reported. To this end, we profiled the human ascites proteome to obtain a pool of biomarker candidates using comprehensive proteomic strategies."

Study Protocol Description	"We collected 50 ml of ascites per patient, who was diagnosed with benign disease (n=31) or stage IV gastric cancer (n=64)."	"For label-free quantitation, three pairs of samples (N=6 per each group) were pooled from ascites of patients with liver cirrhosis or gastric cancer."	"To remove high-abundance proteins, pooled ascites samples were depleted using a MARS-6 column per the manufacturer’s instruction with some modifications. The protein concentration in undepleted and depleted ascites was measured using the BCA assay kit."	"Proteins were digested by filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) procedure."	"The peptide samples were analyzed by online nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), consisting of an Easy-nLC 1000 (Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark) and a Q-Exactive quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer."	"The
MS/MS data were queried against the Uniprot human protein database using the following parameters: MS accuracy, 15 ppm; MS/MS accuracy, 20 mmu for HCD; trypsin digestion with 2 missed cleavages allowed; fixed carbamidomethyl modification of cysteine, +57.0215 Da; and variable modification of oxidized methionine."	"False discovery rates was set to < 1%, and Percolator was used to calculate the probability (q-value) of maintaining the FDR, as measured by the decoy hits at <1% for every peptide-spectrum match (PSM)."
